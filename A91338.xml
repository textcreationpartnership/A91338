         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>GENTLEMEN,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>FOrtune has at laſt gratified me in that earneſt Deſire I have always had to ſerve You; And tho' I deſpair of making due Acknowledgements, yet you may believe, that I am very ſenſible of the Favour you have done me, in ſo u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimouſly chuſing me to be your Servant: for ſuch a one your Recorder is: 'tis a place of Honour and of Truſt, and if I diſcharge it not as I ought, or at leaſt as I am able, I am the worſt of Men: I value my ſelf much upon it, but more upon your Friendſhip. Perhaps ſew Recorders for many ages have been ſo freely Elected, Therefore Gratitude as well as Oath obliges me to be faithfull to you, Intereſt alſo, (a mighty Motive) prompts me to the ſame; I am your Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour as well as fellow Citizen The little Fortune that I have lies near you; if <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> flouriſh, <hi>Elsfield</hi> will not fare the worſe, Gentlemen, I hope you'l have a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable opinion of him you have made yours, It's no inconſiderable diſadvantage to ſucceed a man of ſuch great abilities as your laſt Recorder was, a perſon who liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed long amongſt you, and knew the ſecrets of your Corporation; yet this I vow, I'le pray the aid of all the Inns of Court rather than you ſhall ſuffer; and indeed why ſhould you in any thing? Have you not opportunities enough to be happy? Does not the Great and Good Earl of <hi>Abingdon</hi> offer his aſſiſtance, ready at all times upon his knee to beg his Majeſties Favour in your behalf? When he appears, make room for <hi>Oxford,</hi> cries the Guards, the Town is Loyal grown; when at another time if I may ſpeak it) A modeſt <hi>Oxford</hi> man dare hardly peep in Court. Why then don't we by his vaſt Intereſt let in the Beams of Majeſty upon us? Who can live without the Sun? Have we not a famous Univerſity ſot our Example? Let her great Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty (if it be poſſible) be outdone by us. Can we be poiſon'd at the Fountain head? Where is Learning, Piety, and Obedience practis'd if not in this our Engliſh <hi>Athens?</hi> Who ſo ignorant that does not know how eminent this place has been for Loyalty? How proud it was then <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, that Glorious King, ſhut himſelf up with in our Walls Did not our Citizens follow <hi>Bellona</hi>'s Call, to defend his Sacred per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon from Rebels fury? Was not this the Seat of War? With what bravery and Gallantry did this City aſſert its Monarch's Right? Surely the Stock of Loyalty is not worn out. How many are therein this place now that liv'd in thoſe days, &amp; plaid the Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers part, therefore I'le not think there's an ill man amongſt us, however it happens that for ſome miſcarriages of ours we ſtand not right in <hi>Coeſars</hi> favour: We pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe largely, perform poorly, and that with Grudging too. The Widow's mite, what is it? yet being all, and freely given, had the largeſt thanks. Gentlemen, let me adviſe you to redeem your ſelves again: His Majeſty, whom the Law ſtiles Head of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, Father of the Country, Maſter of the whole Family of the Nation, Chief Juſtice of all England, and a kind of petty God on Earth, who for the excellency of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, by way of reſemblance, has Divine Attributes, as immortality, for as King he never dies, Sovereignty, Majeſty, Power, Verity, Juſtice, &amp; the like: He is merciful, of a God like temper, as ready to forgive as we to ask, let us think nothing but good of him and his Government, for fears and jealouſies have been of fatal conſequence to this Nation, and ſtill are the greateſt enemies to the peace and tranquility of it, ſome times they cry Popery is a breaking in upon us, when God knows (as it is lately prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) the eight hundredth man is not papiſt, unleſs all are ſuch that are not Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters from the Church, for ſo indeed they call us, Did not his Majeſty for ſeveral years live in Popiſh ſoil, yet came over to us as well in Heart as Title, <hi>Defender of the Faith</hi> His Royal Highneſs, Great <hi>Britains Mars,</hi> its Heir and Glory, has upon all occaſions expreſt himſelf-highly in favour of our Church, has ſettled the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:172334:2"/>Proteſtant Religion upon ſuch ſure foundations in <hi>Scotland,</hi> that its not to be ſhaken, Are not his Daughters (after him the preſent Heirs to the Imperid Crown) Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants and, married two ſuch Princes, on deſign purely for to ſecure our Religion, when <hi>France</hi> it ſelf courted that aliance for its Heir, Are not the Lords of the Romiſh Faith excluded the <hi>Houſe</hi> of Peers? the Laws ſtrictly put in execution againſt the <hi>Papiſts?</hi> Beſides What alteration can there be in Church or State, without a Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal conſent? if theſe are ſigns of Popery then indeed we are in danger. What think ye Gentlemen? You are men of Reaſon, live among the Muſes, where Learning is at the height; Though I muſt confeſs, if a papiſt muſt not breath common Air. or tread his Native Earth becauſe he is ſo, tis hard. who does not think his own oppi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on beſt? ſometimes again, how do the fears of arbitrary Power, of loſs of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty and Property call Crowds together to conſult, who ſhake the Head, look down cry we are loſt, ſad times are coming? when that's the only way to have them come for if a people grow Rebel-ripe, why ſhould not we believe that Kings who ſit at ſtern that pick and cull the Nation for the wiſeſt Heads. ſhould not endeavour to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve their Empire, and dominion, as well as quit ſhops and ſtalls and ſly to Coffee houſes to examine every Letter, to ſee how things are like to go with us, Gentlemen be not ſeduced by men of ſeditious ſpirits, The firſt ſin of Men and Angels was Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion. Heaven and Paradiſe were loſt by it, beleive it is the Kings intereſt, as well as Royal inclination to preſerve us in our rights and liberties; for take away property and induſtry is quickly at an end; where is the Crowns ſafety then? the empty travailer laughs at the thief who values his Countrys defence that hath nothing in it which he can call his own? In ſome of the Eaſtern Parts (the Garden of the World by Nature) a man may ride ſome ſcores of Miles, and ſcarcely ſee a Hut; becauſe no man has any thing but at the Princes will; With us the proſperity of the people,, is the Monarchs joy, He always eſteems himſel Rich, if they are ſo.</p>
            <p>Gentlemen, I am not altogether a ſtranger to Hiſtory, can give a reaſonable ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of moſt Countryes, amongſt which <hi>England has not an equal.</hi> Let us ſee how matters ſtood with the <hi>Jews</hi> in Righteous <hi>David</hi>'s days? Thou and <hi>Ziba</hi> divide the Land was <hi>David</hi>'s judgment: againſt his Maſters Son before his offence was prov'd. A Semeter or a Bowſtring Leaves breathleſs in a minute the greateſt Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject in three parts of the <hi>World,</hi> without a Judge and Jury. In our Neighbouring Countries, <hi>Racks &amp; Wheels</hi> are thought gentle eaſie ways to find out truth. the <hi>French</hi> Kings Sword is his Subjects Charter, The <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Inquiſition this <hi>Worlds Hell.</hi> In <hi>Holland</hi> it ſelf, that fam'd Common wealth, Herring is <hi>Excited</hi> nine times before it's eat, yet in theſe places all huſh, and ſtill; No <hi>Plots</hi> to murder Kings, or Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates. Gentlemen, you muſt pardon me, if I tell ye, that many times the too great indulgence of a Prince brings ſpeedy ruine to a Nation. <hi>Flutarch</hi> in the Life of <hi>Lycurgus</hi> gives us a Relation of one <hi>Eurytion</hi> a <hi>Spartan</hi> King, who took a courſe never practis'd by his wife Predeceſſors, which was to <hi>cajole</hi> his own Subjects by ſlackening the Reins of the Royal Authority; but ſee what follow'd, inſtead of gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon them, they grew ſo inſolent, that at laſt they brought the Government into contempt, and ſoon after the whole Kingdom into Anarchy and confuſion, and were never ſatisfied, till one of their beſt Princes was barbarouſly murder'd in the ſtreets by the Rabble, as he was appeaſing a Tumult; How near a Parallel is this to his late Majeſty, who l'le boldly ſay has done more, except the preſent King, to endear the Subject then all the Kings from the <hi>Norman</hi> to this time, beſides; but what come on't? That's a Melancholy conſideration. Mercy and Goodneſs in Princes are too often miſtaken, and call'd neceſſity and eaſineſs of Nature: An yielding King ſhall always find acraving Subject, We are like the <hi>Iſraelits</hi> never ſatisfi'd deſire to return back into <hi>Egypt</hi> into our old Bondage. I have heard, that in the late Rebellion, a Captain and his Company has made <hi>London,</hi> that haughty Miſtreſs of our Iſle, whom we ſo much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to emitate all in tears, her Citizens Crouching like Spaniels at the frown of a Traytor, when at the ſame time they bid defiance to their King.</p>

He is fene'd in on every ſide, the Star, Chamber, Court of Wards, High commiſſion court, and every thing which the people had the leaſt colour to call grievous, are willingly laid aſide. What noiſe has quartering of ſouldiers made? How are the Law booke filli'd with caſes of Impriſonments? To eaſe us of theſe fears too, ther's not a ſouldier looks into a Private houſe, or enters any Inn, but as a Travil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler; the Landlord makes the Bill; what Offender is not bail'd out of Priſon in ſuch a time, if not proſecuted, though Treaſon threw him in? if ſuch Acts of Grace as theſe will not give us grateful ſouls, or at leaſt keep us in quiet, nothing but a rod of iron will, Will there be no peace till <hi>Shebah</hi>'s head is thrown over the <hi>wall.</hi> Gentlemen, I could waſt a day upon this ſubject, and <hi>Challenge all the World</hi> to ſhew me ſuch another Government; therefore if theſe be ſigns of Arbitrary power, of loſs of Liberty and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, ſpeak, Gentlemen, be not ſilent. Good men will be convinc'd by reaſon, and bleſs their Maker for their happineſs; Ill men muſt be watch'd by thoſe that are in Power: He that grumbles at this Government, with <hi>Lucifer</hi> would quarrel Heaven, therefore with him deſerves his puniſhment But ſuppoſe the worſt, that our fears were true, that Religion and Allegiance did no ways oblige us, that his Majeſty had as many vices as he has vertues, would Rebelion mend the matter? No, that a Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on's Ruin is ready to arreſt. Has not that happened to us and much more, which fooliſh <hi>Rehoboam</hi> threatened the ten Tribes with, that his little finger ſhould be hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier upon them than his Father's Loyns; that if his Father whipp'd them with rods he would beat them with Scorpions? Gentlemen, a civil War is like a Gaming houſe where none gets at laſt but the Box keeper.
